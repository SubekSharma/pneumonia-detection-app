## Project Overview
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that requires timely diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques to assist in detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The application supports real-time prediction and visualizes results to help users interpret model outputs.

## Features
- Upload chest X-ray images for pneumonia prediction.
- Real-time predictions using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Simple and interactive user interface.
- Supports both Flask and Streamlit for running the application.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubekSharma/pneumonia-detection.git
   cd pneumonia-detection
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have TensorFlow installed for loading the model.

## Usage
### Running with Flask
1. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python flask_app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Running with Streamlit
1. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
2. Open the link generated by Streamlit in your browser.

### Testing the Model
You can test the application using the provided sample images:
- `test-normal_001.jpg`: Example of a normal chest X-ray.
- `test-pneumonia_028.jpg`: Example of a pneumonia-positive chest X-ray.

## File Descriptions
- `model.h5`: The trained deep learning model for pneumonia detection.
- `flask_app.py`: Flask application script.
- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit application script.
- `pneumonia_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `test-normal_001.jpg` and `test-pneumonia_028.jpg`: Sample X-ray images for testing the application.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- Streamlit
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images. The training dataset and further details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Acknowledgements
